                        Ina ng Buhay Catholic School is the pioneer school in the whole Vicariate of Our Lady of Mercy. School year 1991-1992 was the school’s initial door opening to only 11 preschoolers. From this modest inauguration, there was a popular rise in its enrollment through the succeeding years. Hence, the Department of Education granted the permit and recognition for the school’s continuity of service after of course scrutinizing the quality of its School Officials, faculty and personnel, instructional offerings and facilities.
                                INBCS is the brainchild of Rev. Fr. Jose P. Miranda, Dr. Domingo C. Pascual, Jr., Mr. & Mrs. Rey San Diego, and concerned parishioners. In the mid 80’s there already existed many schools, in the periphery of Ina ng Buhay Parish both private and public. Watching like a diligent shepherd, the group noticed that these schools however, cater only to graders and high school students. So they came to a conclusion: some decisive vocation has to champion the call for the development of the youngest learners with primal focus on value formation. Thus, INBCS began its conception.
                                Barely 12 years has passed and from hardly a formal number of an average class in the preschool, the school is now secured with complete Preschool, Elementary and Secondary Courses thereby releasing its successful intermediate graduates as early as 1995 and its high school graduates as early as 2006.
                                INBCS being a parochial school, is inherently a Manila Archdiocesan and Parochial Schools Association (MAPSA) member and of the Parochial Schools Association of the Diocese of Novaliches (PSA-Nova). For the SY 2009-2010 onwards, PSA-Nova is now RCBN-ES (Roman Catholic Bishop of Novaliches Educational System). Hence, it is an integral part of the pastoral plan of the parish with the prime objective to provide formal Christian education and formation of the clientele specially the parishioners.
                                On its eighth year of service to the community, Fr. Danilo P. Pajarillaga was appointed Director and a new horizon opened up for the entire system. The school is tied up with the Lasallian Schools Supervision Office and the subsequent formal talks sealed the bonding for the school’s inclusion to the La Salle supervised institutions. This affiliation reinforced the anchor of the school, for aside from being a natural merger at MAPSA, it also achieved the status of being a proud member of the DLSU family.
                                The formal LASSO supervision of Ina ng Buhay Catholic School was implemented in school year 1999-2000. This generous sharing between the two institutions lasted for three years only for the school swiftly adapted to the standards set by the LASSO. The supervising body was unanimous in its assessment that the school was ready to start on its own – a clear indication that the Mission set was readily accomplished.
                                On its 17th year (SY2007-2008) of service to the community Rev. Fr. Albert N. Delvo, the PSA-NOVA (Parochial Schools Association of Novaliches District) Superintendent was appointed by Bishop Antonio R. Tobias, D.D. as the Director of Ina ng Buhay Catholic School. It was on this year that the High School Department was recognized having Rev. Fr. Albert N. Delvo as the High School Principal too and Mrs. Emma C. Saludsod as the GS Principal & HS Asst. Principal. For the SY 2008 onwards, we wish to share with you the line up of our School Officials.

                        Ina ng Buhay Catholic School (INBCS) envisions itself as a center for human and Christian discipleship where the learners trace the footsteps of Christ in their lives. Moreso, the learners are trained to upbuild a Christian community which is God fearing (Maka-Diyos), Patriotic (Makabayan), humane (Makatao), and environment- friendly (Makakalikasan). In gist, the school forms its students to become transformed individuals who live not for themselves alone but like Christ who lives for others.
                        Therefore, as a Catholic Institution INBCS is committed to:<br />
                        1. Promote the 5C’s (Competence, Compassion, Confidence, Commitment and Christianity);<br />
                        2. Strengthen religion as the core of the curriculum;<br />
                        3. Deepen the faith – life of the learners through the sacraments instituted by Christ and celebrated by the Catholic Church;<br />
                        4. Ensure Catholic formation inspired by the Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of Life, and rooted in genuine faith and charity in serving others; and<br />
                        5. Provide programs and activities to develop learners’ talents, skills, creativity, & practice of the Christian Values; thereby, becoming an agent of the Church, touching the lives of the INBCSians, their families and neighbors.

                        Oh blessed school we sing you our praise<br />
                        To you who gives us grace<br />
                        With humble beginnings we serve as light<br />
                        To the future that’s glorious and bright<br /><br />

                        As a family we’re together<br /><br />
                        
                        Let us raise our hearts to the Lord<br />

                        Our faith will be our sword<br />
                        
                        With goals so high and with wings to fly<br />
                        We will surely achieve everything we try<br /><br />
                        
                        Aim high Ina ng Buhay<br />
                        Make your star shine so bright in the sky (2x)<br /><br />
